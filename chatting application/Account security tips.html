   <h2>Account security tips</h2> 
   <p>To better secure your WhatsApp account, follow these tips:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Never share your registration code or two-step verification PIN with others.</li><br>
    <li>Enable <span class="dell"> two-step verification</span> and provide an email address in case you forget your PIN.</li><br>
    <li>Set a voicemail password on your phone that's difficult to guess to prevent anyone from accessing your voicemail.</li><br>
    <li>Check your linked devices regularly. Go to WhatsApp <strong> Settings </strong>>  <strong>Linked Devices</strong> to review all devices linked to your account. To remove a linked device, tap the device ><strong> Log Out</strong>.</li>
    <li>Set a device code and be aware of who has physical access to your phone. Someone who has physical access to your phone might use your WhatsApp account without your permission.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend you share this advice with friends and family to help secure their WhatsApp accounts.</p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>If you receive unrequested emails to reset your two-step verification PIN or registration code, don't click on any links. Someone could be attempting to access your phone number on ChatApp.</p>
