    <h2>About the Google warning “This app is fake..."</h2>
    <p>If you've received this Play Protect Warning from Google, you're likely using an unofficial version of chatsApp. Due to security concerns, Google may disable and uninstall these applications.</p>
    <p>Unofficial ChatsApp apps are altered versions developed by third-parties and violate our Terms of Service. We don’t support these apps because they put your privacy, security, and safety at risk. Learn more about unofficial versions of ChatsApp in this article.</p>
    <h2>How to switch to the official Chat app</h2>
    <p>Uninstall the unofficial app, then go to our website to download ChatsApp or the ChatsApp Business app and re-register your phone number. Learn how to register in this article.</p>
    <p>We can’t guarantee that your chat history will transfer because ChatsApp doesn't support unofficial apps.</p>
