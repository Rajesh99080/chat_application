  <h2>How to change your privacy settings</h2> 
  <p>You can adjust your privacy settings to control who can see your information and contact you. By default, WhatsApp sets your privacy settings to:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>Any user can see your profile photo, read receipts, and when you’re online.</li><br>
    <li>Your contacts can see your status updates, about information, and when you were last seen.</li><br>
    <li>Any users can add you to groups or mention you in a status. </li><br>
    <li>The default message timer for disappearing messages is turned off. </li><br>
    <li>Unknown callers will be able to call you.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Note:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Users you’ve saved as a contact or who you’ve messaged before can see your last seen and online.</li><br>
    <li>When someone reshares your status from a status mention, they can edit and reshare the content of your status to their own audience. Your name, profile information and phone number are not displayed in the reshared status. Learn more about status mentions.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>If you don't share your last seen or online, you can’t see other users’ last seen or online.</li><br>
    <li>If you select Everyone in settings for last seen or online, only those you’ve called and messaged before, or who you’ve saved as a contact, can see your last seen and online.</li><br>
    <li>If you turn off read receipts, you can’t see read receipts from other users. Read receipts are always sent for group chats.</li><br>
    <li>If a contact turns off read receipts, you can’t see if they’ve viewed your status updates.</li><br>
    <li>There is no way to hide your phone number when using WhatsApp. Your phone number will still be visible even if the recipient has not saved your number in their contact list.</li>
