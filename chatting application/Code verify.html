    <h2>About Code Verify</h2>
    <p>Code Verify adds an extra layer of security to end-to-end encryption when people use WhatsApp on the web.</p>
    <p>When you download the Code Verify web browser extension from the official <span class="dell"> Google Chrome</span>,<span class="dell"> Mozilla Firefox</span>, and <span class="dell">Microsoft Edge</span> browser extension stores, it automatically checks whether youâ€™re using an authentic and untampered version of WhatsApp Web so you can be confident that your messages are between you and your intended recipients, and nobody else. If the extension detects that the code you're using to run WhatsApp Web is not the same as the code that everyone else is using, the extension notifies you so that you can take action.</p>
