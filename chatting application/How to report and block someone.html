    <h2>How to block and report someone</h2>
    <p>You can stop receiving messages, calls, and status updates from someone by blocking them. You can also report them if you think they are sending problematic content or spam.<br><br>
        When you block someone, the existing chat will remain in your chatlist. You can <span class="dell"> delete the chat completely </span> if you want to remove it from your chatlist, or archive the chat instead. You can also unblock the sender to receive new messages from them.<br><br>
        You can’t block a group. Alternatively, you can exit a group and block the group admin. Learn how in <span class=dell>this article</span>. You can also adjust your privacy settings to prevent unknown contacts from adding you to groups. Learn more in<span class="dell"> this article</span>.<br><br>
        If you feel you or anyone else is in immediate danger, please contact your local emergency services.</p>

                <li>If you're concerned about whether a blocked contact will know you're blocking them, read this article.</li><br>
                <li>If you change your phone number and use the same WhatsApp account, your blocked contacts will stay blocked. Learn how to use the change number feature in this article.</li><br>
                <li>If you set up a new WhatsApp account, you’ll need to manually block those contacts again.
                </li><br>
            <li>Blocking a contact won't remove them from your contacts list, nor will it remove you from the list on the contact's phone. To delete a contact, you'll need to delete the contact from your phone's address book.</li>

        <h2>Report someone</h2>
        <p>WhatsApp receives the last five messages sent to you by the reported sender or group, and they won’t be notified. WhatsApp also receives:
            <ul>
                <li>The reported group or user ID.</li><br>
                <li>Information about when the message was sent, and the type of message sent such as an image, video, or text.</li>
            </ul>
            If you report a group, you’ll be removed from that group. If you’d like to rejoin a group you reported, the group admin will need to invite you again to the group.
